## :books: Assessment
This course (2 weeks) is all about functional programming in Javascript. I'm learning how to clean a dataset with Javascript. I'm very new to writing code, especially with Javascript. For example, this is the first time I'm writing a README and fetching data from an external API. So it's more like a learning proces than that it is a usable product/app.

## :bulb: Concept

As i said, during these two weeks the most important thing for me is learning more about Javascript and getting used to working with Github. Despite my lack of experience and knowledge about Javascript, I still managed to work something out. 

I'm fetching data from the Last.fm API, Last.fm is an music streaming service. I'm using this API to retrieve certain data from music artists. with the code that I wrote I can see which artists have the most dedicated fans. The goal of this course is understanding functional programming. So I tried to wrote the code as functional as posible.

## :bulb: Proces (Wiki)
Click [here](https://github.com/samclarkb/Functional-programming/wiki/Logboek-Functional-Programming) for a more detailed overview about my working proces. 

## :memo: Wishlist
There are a few things I didn't get done due to lack of time:
* Experimenting with Writing more functions for cleaning data 
* Experimenting with the _Issues_ on Github
* dive into the phenomene _promise_ in Javascript
* Understanding _branches_ within Github
* Putting indiviual functions in modules

## :wrench: Installation
If you want to use this code, you can clone my repository with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/samclarkb/Functional-programming`
