## :books: Assessment
This course (2 weeks) is all about functional programming in Javascript. I'm learning how to clean a dataset with Javascript. I'm very new to writing code, especially with Javascript. For example, this is the first time I'm writing a README and fetching data from an external API. So it's more like a learning proces than that it is a usable product/app.

## :bulb: Concept
As i said, during these two weeks the most important thing for me is learning more about Javascript and getting used to working with Github. So don't expect to much from my product/app.

Despite my lack of experience and knowledge about Javascript, I still managed to work something out.

## :bulb: Proces (Wiki)
Click [here](https://github.com/samclarkb/Functional-programming/wiki/Logboek-Functional-Programming) for a more detailed overview about my working proces. 

## :memo: Wishlist
There are a few things I didn't get done due to lack of time:
* Experimenting with Writing more functions for cleaning data 
* Experimenting with the _Issues_ on Github
* dive into the phenomene _promise_ in Javascript
* Understanding _branches_ within Github

## :wrench: Installation
If you want to use this code, you can clone my repository with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/samclarkb/Functional-programming`
